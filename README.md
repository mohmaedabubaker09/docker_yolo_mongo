# Lana Bot - Telegram Smart Chat Bot

## Project Overview

Lana Bot is a project that combines modern DevOps practices. It leverages Docker, Python, APIs, and MongoDB to create a dynamic, multi-container Docker application. Each container in this system plays a unique role, working together to process and respond to data in real-time using AI and machine learning.

## Architecture

The application is structured around Docker containers, each serving a specific purpose:

- **Telegram Bot Container (`mohamedabubaker09/lana_bot`):** Hosts Python scripts (`app.py` and `bot.py`) for Telegram API interactions and integrates OpenAI API for text processing. Also, interacts with Amazon S3 for image storage and retrieval.
- **YOLOv5 Container (`mohamedabubaker09/lana_yolo5`):** Dedicated to image processing with YOLOv5, handling image detection and analysis.
- **MongoDB Containers (`mongo1`, `mongo2`, `mongo3`):** Forms a MongoDB replica set, ensuring data availability and redundancy for persistent data storage.

## Project Overview

Lana Bot is an innovative project that combines modern DevOps practices with cutting-edge technologies. It leverages Docker, Python, APIs, and MongoDB to create a dynamic, multi-container Docker application. Each container in this system plays a unique role, working together to process and respond to data in real-time using AI and machine learning.

## Architecture

The application is structured around Docker containers, each serving a specific purpose:

- **Telegram Bot Container (`mohamedabubaker09/lana_bot`):** Hosts Python scripts (`app.py` and `bot.py`) for Telegram API interactions and integrates OpenAI API for text processing. Also, interacts with Amazon S3 for image storage and retrieval.

- **MongoDB Containers (`mongo1`, `mongo2`, `mongo3`):** Forms a MongoDB replica set, ensuring data availability and redundancy for persistent data storage.

## Functionality

The bot is powered by Python scripts, with `app.py` managing HTTP requests. The `bot.py` script handles Telegram API interactions, message processing, coordinates with YOLOv5 and S3, and manages the overall operational flow. The YOLOv5 container processes images and communicates results back to the Telegram bot.

## DevOps Integrations

Key DevOps practices integrated into the project:

- **Docker Containerization:** Provides consistency, simplifies deployment, and isolates dependencies.
- **CI/CD:** Enables automated testing and deployment.
- **GitHub Version Control:** Facilitates collaborative development and effective change management.
- **Monitoring and Security:** Utilizes Snyk for vulnerability scanning and NGROK for secure tunneling.

## Challenges and Solutions

The project addressed challenges in container communication and data consistency through Docker networks and MongoDB's replica set, ensuring seamless operation and data integrity.

## Conclusion

Lana Bot is a testament to the practical application of DevOps, AI, and cloud services in software development. It showcases the effectiveness of Docker and Python in real-time data processing, emphasizing agility, scalability, and robustness.
